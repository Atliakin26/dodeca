BEFORE REFACTORING - Baseline Measurements
==========================================

Top LLVM IR Contributors from DerivedIngredient:
------------------------------------------------
  234,836 lines (12.0% of total) - access_scoped::{{closure}} - 50 copies
   31,100 lines ( 1.6% of total) - try_revalidate::{{closure}} - 50 copies
   19,765 lines ( 1.0% of total) - save_records::{{closure}} - 27 copies
   15,169 lines ( 0.8% of total) - restore_runtime_state::{{closure}} - 27 copies
   11,751 lines ( 0.6% of total) - snapshot_cells_deep::{{closure}} - 27 copies

Total LLVM IR: 1,952,157 lines across 41,947 function copies

Key Finding:
-----------
The state machine (access_scoped) alone accounts for 12% of ALL LLVM IR!
This is monomorphized 50 times for different (DB,K,V) combinations.

Expected Improvement:
--------------------
After refactoring, access_scoped should compile to ~1 copy instead of 50,
reducing IR from 234,836 lines to ~4,696 lines (50x reduction).

Build Time Measurements:
------------------------
Clean build time: 25.53s (wall clock)
  - CPU time: 119.76s user + 8.60s system
  - Parallelism: ~501% (5x cores utilized)

Top compile-time consumers (from self-profile):
  - LLVM codegen (emit_obj): 32.23s (23.2% of total)
  - LLVM optimize: 27.22s (19.6%)
  - LLVM LTO optimize: 19.75s (14.2%)
  
Total instrumented compile time: ~139s
